# Bugs
CS32 Project 3

The goal of this project is to create a graphic simulation of a game called Bugs! where competitors write simple pseudocode
algorithms to control the actions of ants. Each competitor has a home colony that starts out by spawning 5 ants. The winning
colony is the one that has created the most ants by the end of the simulation.
